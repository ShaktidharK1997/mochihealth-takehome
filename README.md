# Mood of the Queue - Mochi Health Takehome

Hey there! So for my take-home, I built a Streamlit app to track the mood/sentiment of support tickets over time. Nothing fancy, but hopefully useful!

## What it does

This app tracks emotional trends in your support queue:

- Log moods with emojis (ðŸ˜Š happy, ðŸ˜• confused, ðŸ˜  frustrated, ðŸŽ‰ celebratory)
- Add notes to provide context
- See a daily visualization of mood distribution
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds (optional)
- All data stored in a Google Sheet using a service account

## Setup 

I've set it up using Streamlit Cloud Free version. Check it out at https://mochihealth-takehome-h5uj4gtmrkusegeujbbjnl.streamlit.app/

You can also run it locally by cloning this repo and using Docker-compose. 

## Technical bits

- Built with Streamlit + Pandas + Google Sheets API
- Uses Plotly for visualizations
- Stores credentials securely using Streamlit secrets

## Next steps

With more time, I'd add:
- integrate this with the support ticket platform to read the ticket information and use an LLM to understand the ticket emotion and automatically create a mood entry based on it. 
- Understand Historical trends beyond today and create regression models to predict the support tickets in the near future (subject to scale of data available)
- Data export features

Lemme know if you need any additional info or have questions!
